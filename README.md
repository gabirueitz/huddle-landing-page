## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For icons styles

### What I learned

A responsive design is really a challenge, it took me a while to understand how flexbox really works, but once I got it, the work flowed.

### Useful resources

- [CSS FlexBox guide](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/css-guia-do-flexbox?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIncOMipqo_wIVzGtMCh2WBAx9EAAYASAAEgIMJfD_BwE) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
